# Gradient-Informed Path Smoothing for Wheeled Mobile Robots (GRIPS)
C++ implementation of a post-smoothing approach that improves the quality of paths generated by sampling-based planners.

## Requirements
* CMake >=3
* Eigen 3
* [OMPL ~1.3.1](https://github.com/ompl/ompl/releases)
* Qt5 (ensure the Qt Charts and SVG packages are installed)

## Content
The following CMake targets are available:

| CMake target      | Description                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `homotopy_test`   | Compares paths from Theta* and A* before/after post-smoothing w.r.t homotopy class |
| `benchmark`       | Compares different post-smoothing and path planning algorithms (cf. Table 1) and generates statistics JSON in `log` folder |
| `shortening_test` | Compares path-shortening results on hand-crafted path (Fig. 2)                     |
| `showcase`        | Visualizes post-smoothing of Theta* path in S-shaped environment (Fig. 3)          |


## Used third-party tools
* [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) to store path statistics data for plotting
* [palmieri/posq](https://github.com/palmieri/posq) steer function for differential drive robots
